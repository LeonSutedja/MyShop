This folder is to handle various MVC pages.

In here, rather than using the normal Model-View-Controller folder provided by the Framework, we combine the
relevant of all component into one place. The idea is to be able to easily managed the relevant component together.

Each folder is a representation of a particular context. It may have multiple controllers that belongs to that context.
Views that are relevant and any models necessary for the controller to run can be put inside the same folder.
